# Face Mask Detection
The zip contains two executable files - `resnet18.py` and `resnet50.py` - which implement face mask detection using ResNet18 and ResNet50 deep learning models, respectively.

The results and analysis for the pipelines are shown in python notebooks.

## Run the files using the following steps:
---
- Extract the zip to your local machine.
- Make sure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip by running pip install -r `requirements.txt`
- Download the pre-trained ResNet18 from the zip and place them in the root directory:
ResNet18: `"Resnet18.tflite"`

- Run the resnet18.py or resnet50.py file using the command `python resnet18.py` or `python resnet50.py`, respectively. 

## Flutter Application
---
Run the installation for flutter application file or `.apk` file given in zip.

This will launch the application, which will allow you to detect face masks in real-time using your computer's webcam.

The video tutorial for the application can be found at the following link: [Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1esaI-oXfDUvRR7W3aCfnlflw_MXcbQPs/view)
